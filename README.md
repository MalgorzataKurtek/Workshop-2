The application is designed as an introduction to the Data Access Object (DAO) workshop, focusing on creating an object-oriented data access layer. It features the UserDao class, enabling operations on a database named workshop2, specifically on a table named users. This table includes columns for id, email, username, and password, with id being an auto-increment primary key.

Key functionalities of the application include:
- Adding a User: Insert new user records into the database.
- Modifying Data: Update existing user records based on their unique ID.
- Retrieving by ID: Fetch a specific user's details using their ID.
- Deleting by ID: Remove a user record from the database using their ID.
- Retrieving All Users: List all user records currently stored in the database.

This workshop aims to provide hands-on experience with Java and SQL, combining knowledge from Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and MySQL.
